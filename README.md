### _Muddiness of Mud_ 

â€‹	This program is a game that involves a human being controlled by the arrow key inputs of the user. The player is an image controlled by gravity. The player must avoid the mud balls going from the right side of the screen to the left side. These mud balls have a random spawn everytime they exit the screen and the speed is modulated by the amplitude of the sound. This ensures for randomness and adds to the game. There is a counter for the number of mudballs you avoid to keep track of score.If the player is hit, a new screen is made with the player in the mud referring to the poem where a person is stuck in the mud and all
he can think of is the muddiness of mud.

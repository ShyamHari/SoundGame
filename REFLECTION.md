​	During the course of the project I truly thought that it would be tougher than it was. Constantly worried about the standard that I had to produce, it created "Coders Block" in my head and it was hard to get any ideas flowing. Eventually once I was able to find an idea for my game, it got even worse. I constantly doubted whether I would be able to code it or not. It would've made for a much more original game if I was able to pull it off. The final game design was much simpler and it was essentially trying to avoid mud coming at the character. Midway through the game, I realized I needed object detection. Since objects were completely new to me, including the whole aspect of p5.js I had to sit through a couple of Daniel Shiffman videos which took up time from other subjects. It took me about two days to even implement objects into my code, and even after all that, I did not understand objects 100%. 

​	I think a major factor that improved my code was the fact that a certain person was able to help out in creating images to implement in my game to add to the graphic component of it. Moreover, understanding a little bit of objects may help me out in the future so it was a success in terms of that. I also think that the experience of working with sound and implementation was quite challenging and interesting to me so this assignment overall was really fun to complete and I'm glad to have got the opportunity to. 

​	Time restraints were also an issue that I didn't expect to encounter. Normally for the other assignments, I am able to finish them in ample time and I have time to relax. For this assignment it really made me value the time we have to complete assignments as the number of questions and the bugs I had with the new program and area of sound took up quite a bit of time. 

​	Overall, I think that the experience of doing this assignment was amazing and that I learned a lot more doing this assignment than I have in the past which made it so much more interesting. Along with this, the problems that occurred, like time restraints, unknown areas (objects, sound etc.) and "Coder's Block" really prepared me for what can happen when you have full control over your own project.
